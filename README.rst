**Sequanix** is a derivative of the **Sequana** project that is dedicated to the analyse of NGS data (sequencing data). We provide a set of NGS pipelines  including quality control, variant calling, coverage, taxonomy, transcriptomics. Please see the Sequana `documentation <http://sequana.readthedocs.org>`_ for an up-to-date status and further information.

Design choice
#############

Uses PySide6 from v0.2.0. See e.g., https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/pyqt6-vs-pyside6/ from information
on the switch to PySide6. In brief, the Qt project has recently adopted PySide as the official Qt for Python release which should ensure its viability going forward. When we migrate PyQt5 to PyQt6, we therefore decided to use PySide instead of PyQt.
